Instantly replace your standard WordPress [gallery] with JonDesign's SmoothGallery.

== Description ==
Smooth Gallery Replacement will replace your standard WordPress galleries (using the gallery-shortcode) with JonDesign's [SmoothGallery](http://smoothgallery.jondesign.net/showcase/gallery/). 

There are two other plugins for running SmoothGallery in Wordpress: "SmoothGallery", which requires manual markup to be added to your posts. And "NextGEN Smooth Gallery", which requires you to use the NextGEN Gallery plugin. 

This plugin is a self contained drop-in that requires no effort from you and no changes to your blog. It degrades gracefully for non-JavaScript browsers and removing the plugin leaves your galleries working just like they did before.

**Be warned:** SmoothGallery is built on [MooTools](http://mootools.net/) and will not work if you run [Scriptaculous](http://script.aculo.us/) on your blog.

**Changelog 1.0 (2009-03-17)**

== Installation ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= IT DOESN'T WORK! =
[SmoothGallery](http://smoothgallery.jondesign.net/) is built on the [MooTools JavaScript framework](http://mootools.net/), which is incompatible with the [Scriptaculous library](http://script.aculo.us/) bundled with WordPress. If you're currently using Scriptacolous, this plugin will not be of any joy for you.

= How do I create WordPress galleries?  =
Use the built-in media uploader to create and insert galleries in your posts. See [the screencast](http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-rc2/) (at 01:35), or [read the instructions](http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Images#Inserting_Images_into_Posts).

= How do I ask for help? =
1. Search [the forums](http://wordpress.org/tags/Smooth-Gallery-Replacement) and post in a relevant thread if one exists.
1. Always tag your post with `Smooth Gallery Replacement`
1. State your problem succintly, *provide a link*!
1. Always tag your post `resolved` and publish your solution.
